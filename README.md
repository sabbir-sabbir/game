 # 🎮 Number Guessing Game in Python 🐍
 ## Welcome to my very first Python project!
### This is a simple yet fun Number Guessing Game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and it's your job to guess it!
### The game gives you hints whether to guess higher or lower and tracks how many attempts it takes you to get it right.

### 🔍 How It Works
### The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100

### You keep guessing until you find the correct number

### You'll get hints like:

### "Enter Higher number Please !!"

### "Enter Lower Number Please !!"

### Your total number of guesses will be counted

### If you finish in 10 or fewer guesses, you get a motivational badge 🎯

### 🧠 Skills Used
### This project helped me practice:

### Working with the random module

### Using while loops and conditional logic

### Handling user input with input()

### Basic function design

### Encouraging replay functionality



You can download it from Release section as a .exe file and run in you cmd termial
# or
You can fork the repo and run it in your vs code terminal




# 📈 Future Ideas (Maybe 😉)
## Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)

## Implement a scoreboard or save high scores

## Add exception handling for invalid inputs

## GUI version using Tkinter or PyGame
